A Memory Card Game

# Kiyoku - Japanese term for Memory

## About
> The classic game where the game board displays multiple cards all upside down and each card has a corresponding pair that matches the current card selected.
> Upon selecting a card, the card flips and shows the image beneath it.
> The player needs to select another card hoping to make a correct match. If wrong then both cards flip upside down again. After making a correct match, both cards remain in revealed state and the game continues.
> The game keeps count of players' total moves along with the time elapsed.
> The game finishes when the player has made all correct card matches and display a small message showing that the player has won.
> There's a reset button that restarts the game and each time the game starts, the cards get shuffled randomly.
> This game will test the memory of the player as well as their efficiency.
